# Bookmarklets
Some useful bookmarklets written to save time. For fastest operation, name these so you can execute them from the omnibar. (I plan on extending this list in the future)

## TimeModified
Simply returns the date and time of last time the page was modified. Most useful for referencing purposes. 

## YouTubeDL
Used to copy windows terminal command to clipboard for fast video download and audio conversion using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl). Perhaps an optimised version would also launch the terminal upon execution. 
MacOS terminal support added.

## YouTubeAccelerate
When `x2` is just not fast enough, use this bookmarklet to copy the comand to clip board before pasting in the browser console for fine grain acceleration on YouTube. `x2.5` default value chosen. (abandoned as superceeded by [Tampermonkey scripts](https://github.com/raullm7/Faster-Slower-buttons-for-Youtube) or [chrome extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-playback-speed-co/hdannnflhlmdablckfkjpleikpphncik))
